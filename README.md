**v0.1.0**

Manage OSCAL compliance packages using [Compliance Trestle](https://oscal-compass.dev/compliance-trestle) — a CNCF sandbox project for machine-readable compliance documentation (NIST OSCAL standard).

## What's New in v0.1.0

**Skill depth pass** — all 10 skills now include worked examples, troubleshooting tables, and cross-references:

- **Control implementation**: Full AC-2 worked example, parameter precedence rules, multi-part and compensating controls
- **Assessment & POA&M**: Step-by-step SAP/SAR creation walkthroughs, finding-to-POA&M pipeline, milestone patterns (30/90/180-day)
- **Task system**: CSV column reference, task testing workflow, XCCDF/Tanium/CIS troubleshooting
- **Validation**: CI/CD patterns (GitHub Actions, pre-commit hooks), split-file validation, assessment/POA&M-specific issues
- **Jinja & Governance**: Assessment + POA&M report templates, security policy template example, versioned migration patterns

## Prerequisites

## Hooks

The plugin includes event hooks that activate automatically:

| **Workspace Detection** | SessionStart | Detects trestle workspace, shows model inventory and available commands |
| **Validation Reminder** | PostToolUse (Bash) | After `trestle assemble`, `trestle import`, `trestle merge`, `trestle create`, or `trestle split`, provides contextual guidance |
| **OSCAL Edit Warning** | PreToolUse (Write/Edit) | Warns when directly editing OSCAL JSON/YAML files (should use authoring workflow) |

## Configuration

Per-project settings are stored in `.claude/compliance-trestle.local.md` (gitignored by default).

Run `/compliance-trestle:workspace-configure` to set up or modify settings:

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `auto_validate` | `true` | Remind to validate after assembly/import |
| `default_catalog` | (empty) | Default catalog for authoring workflows |
| `default_profile` | (empty) | Default profile for SSP generation |
| `validation_level` | `normal` | `strict` treats warnings as errors |
| `ssp_format` | `markdown` | Preferred SSP editing format |

## Quick Start
