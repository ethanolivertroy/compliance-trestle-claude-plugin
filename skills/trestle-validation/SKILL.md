# Trestle Validation and Troubleshooting

## Validation Commands

### Validate All Models
```bash
trestle validate -a
```
Validates every OSCAL model in the workspace.

### Validate by Type
```bash
trestle validate -t catalog -n my-catalog
trestle validate -t profile -n my-profile
trestle validate -t component-definition -n my-compdef
trestle validate -t system-security-plan -n my-ssp
trestle validate -t assessment-plan -n my-assessment
trestle validate -t assessment-results -n my-results
trestle validate -t plan-of-action-and-milestones -n my-poam
```

### Validate Specific File
```bash
trestle validate -f catalogs/my-catalog/catalog.json
```

## Common Validation Errors

### Schema Validation Errors

| Error | Cause | Fix |
|-------|-------|-----|
| `Additional properties not allowed` | Extra fields in JSON not in OSCAL schema | Remove the unexpected field |
| `required property 'uuid' missing` | Missing required UUID field | Add a valid UUID (`python -c "import uuid; print(uuid.uuid4())"`) |
| `is not of type 'string'` | Wrong data type for a field | Check the OSCAL schema for expected type |
| `does not match pattern` | Value doesn't match expected regex | Check format requirements (e.g., UUID, date-time) |

### Workspace Structure Errors

| Error | Cause | Fix |
|-------|-------|-----|
| `Not in a trestle workspace` | No `.trestle/` directory found | Run `trestle init` or navigate to workspace root |
| `Model not found` | Model directory or file doesn't exist | Check spelling, ensure model was imported |
| `Duplicate model names` | Two models share the same name | Rename one of the conflicting models |

### Authoring Errors (Generate/Assemble)

| Error | Cause | Fix |
|-------|-------|-----|
| `Markdown directory not found` | Generated markdown directory missing | Run `trestle author *-generate` first |
| `YAML header parse error` | Invalid YAML in markdown frontmatter | Fix YAML syntax in the control markdown file |
| `Unexpected markdown structure` | Manual edits broke expected format | Regenerate markdown and reapply changes |
| `Parameter not found` | Reference to non-existent parameter ID | Check parameter IDs in catalog/profile |

### Import Errors

| Error | Cause | Fix |
|-------|-------|-----|
| `Invalid OSCAL model` | Source file isn't valid OSCAL | Validate the source file against OSCAL schema |
| `Model type mismatch` | File content doesn't match `-t` flag | Verify the model type or omit `-t` for auto-detection |
| `File format not supported` | Unsupported file extension | Use `.json` or `.yaml`/`.yml` |

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Step 1: Check Workspace Health
```bash
# Verify workspace
ls -la .trestle/

# Check config
cat .trestle/config.ini

# List all models
ls catalogs/ profiles/ component-definitions/ system-security-plans/ 2>/dev/null
```

### Step 2: Run Full Validation
```bash
trestle validate -a 2>&1
```

### Step 3: Check Individual Models
For each model that fails validation:
```bash
# Validate specific model with verbose output
trestle validate -t <type> -n <name>

# Check the model file directly
python -c "import json; json.load(open('<path>/model.json'))"
```

### Step 4: Common Fixes

#### Fix Invalid UUIDs
```python
import uuid
print(str(uuid.uuid4()))
```
Replace any malformed or missing UUIDs with fresh ones.

#### Fix YAML Header Issues in Markdown
Common YAML problems in control markdown:
- Missing quotes around values with special characters
- Incorrect indentation (YAML requires consistent spaces, not tabs)
- Missing `---` delimiters around frontmatter

#### Fix Broken Import References
Profiles reference catalogs by href. Check:
```json
"imports": [
  { "href": "trestle://catalogs/nist-800-53/catalog.json" }
]
```
The referenced catalog must exist at that path in the workspace.

#### Fix Assembly Failures
If assemble fails after markdown edits:
1. Check the YAML header hasn't been corrupted
2. Verify no structural markdown elements were deleted (headers, dividers)
3. Try regenerating and re-applying changes:
   ```bash
   trestle author ssp-generate --name <ssp> --output <md_dir>-fresh
   ```
   Then diff the fresh output against your edited version.

### Step 5: Reset and Recover

If a model is badly corrupted:
1. Check if `dist/` has a previously assembled good copy
2. Re-import from the original source
3. Use git history to recover previous versions

## Validation Best Practices

1. **Validate after every change**: Run `trestle validate` after imports, edits, and assemblies
2. **Validate before committing**: Add validation to your pre-commit workflow
3. **Use CI/CD validation**: Run `trestle validate -a` in pipelines
4. **Keep backups**: Assemble to `dist/` regularly as validated snapshots
5. **Version control**: Use git to track all changes to OSCAL models
6. **One format per directory**: Don't mix JSON and YAML in the same model directory

## Error Message Reference

Trestle validation errors follow this pattern:
```
ERROR: [model_type] [model_name]: [error_description]
```

When reporting issues:
- Include the full error message
- Note which command triggered the error
- Provide the trestle version (`trestle version`)
- Include the Python version (`python --version`)

## What Each Validator Checks

Trestle includes several specialized validators that go beyond basic schema validation:

| Validator | What It Checks | What It Misses | When to Use |
|-----------|---------------|----------------|-------------|
| `duplicates` | Duplicate UUIDs within a single model | Cross-model UUID collisions | After manual UUID edits or model merges |
| `refs` | Internal UUID cross-references resolve (e.g., a finding's `related-observations` points to a real observation UUID) | References to external models | After editing assessment-results or POA&M files with UUID references |
| `links` | `href` values point to files and resources that exist | Whether the linked content is valid OSCAL | After restructuring workspace directories or renaming files |
| `catalog` | Catalog-specific structure: valid groups, controls, parameters, and back-matter | Semantic correctness of control text | After importing or manually editing catalogs |
| `rules` | Component-definition rule consistency: rule IDs, parameter references, and control mappings | Whether rules are actually testable | After `csv-to-oscal-cd` or manual component-definition edits |

Run specific validators with:
```bash
trestle validate -t <model-type> -n <model-name>
```

All validators run automatically as part of `trestle validate -a`.

## Validating Split Files

After using `trestle split`, individual fragment files are not standalone valid OSCAL documents. Validation must follow the correct workflow:

1. **Never validate mid-split** — a split model's root file references child files via the trestle split convention. The individual pieces won't pass schema validation on their own.

2. **Always merge before validating**:
   ```bash
   trestle merge -e catalog.*        # merge all split parts back
   trestle validate -t catalog -n my-catalog
   ```

3. **Partial sanity check** — while you shouldn't schema-validate split files, you can verify they are valid JSON:
   ```bash
   python -c "import json, pathlib; [json.loads(p.read_text()) for p in pathlib.Path('.').rglob('*.json')]"
   ```

4. **Pattern**: The correct workflow is always **split → edit → merge → validate**. Never skip the merge step before validation.

## CI/CD Validation Patterns

### GitHub Actions Workflow

```yaml
name: OSCAL Validation

on:
  pull_request:
    paths:
      - 'catalogs/**'
      - 'profiles/**'
      - 'component-definitions/**'
      - 'system-security-plans/**'
      - 'assessment-results/**'
      - 'plan-of-action-and-milestones/**'

jobs:
  validate:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v5
        with:
          python-version: '3.11'

      - name: Install trestle
        run: pip install compliance-trestle

      - name: Initialize trestle workspace
        run: |
          cd ${{ github.workspace }}
          trestle init --govdocs

      - name: Validate all OSCAL models
        run: |
          trestle validate -a 2>&1 | tee validation-report.txt
          if grep -q "ERROR" validation-report.txt; then
            echo "::error::OSCAL validation failed"
            exit 1
          fi

      - name: Validate governed docs
        run: trestle author docs validate -tn policies -hv

      - name: Upload validation report
        if: always()
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: validation-report
          path: validation-report.txt
```

### Pre-commit Hook

```yaml
# .pre-commit-config.yaml
repos:
  - repo: local
    hooks:
      - id: trestle-validate
        name: Validate OSCAL models
        entry: bash -c 'trestle validate -a'
        language: system
        pass_filenames: false
        files: '\.(json|yaml|yml)$'
```

**Tip**: For faster feedback during development, validate only the model you changed:
```bash
trestle validate -t system-security-plan -n my-ssp
```
Reserve `trestle validate -a` for CI/CD pipelines.

## Validation After Assessment and POA&M Edits

Assessment results and POA&M documents use JSON-based workflows (split/merge rather than generate/assemble). Validation is critical after every merge because these models have dense UUID cross-references.

### Common Assessment Validation Issues

| Issue | Cause | Fix |
|-------|-------|-----|
| Missing `import-ap` href | Assessment results must reference an assessment plan | Set `import-ap.href` to a valid path (e.g., `trestle://assessment-plans/my-plan/assessment-plan.json`) |
| Findings without `target.status` | Every finding needs a determination status | Add `target.status.state` with value `satisfied` or `not-satisfied` |
| Orphaned observation UUIDs | A finding references an observation that was deleted | Update the finding's `related-observations` list or restore the observation |

### Common POA&M Validation Issues

| Issue | Cause | Fix |
|-------|-------|-----|
| Broken observation UUID references | POA&M item references a non-existent observation | Check `poam-items[].related-observations` UUIDs match actual observations |
| Broken risk UUID references | POA&M item references a non-existent risk | Check `poam-items[].related-risks` UUIDs match actual risks in the model |
| Missing `import-ssp` href | POA&M must reference its parent SSP | Set `import-ssp.href` to the SSP path |

**Tip**: Always validate with the specific type for faster feedback:
```bash
trestle validate -t assessment-results -n my-results
trestle validate -t plan-of-action-and-milestones -n my-poam
```

## Cross-References

- **trestle-authoring-workflow**: The generate → assemble cycle where validation catches structural errors before they propagate
- **trestle-assessment**: JSON-based assessment-results workflow where `refs` validation is essential
- **trestle-poam**: JSON-based POA&M workflow with dense UUID cross-references requiring `refs` and `duplicates` validation
- **trestle-governance**: Combining OSCAL schema validation with document structure validation for complete coverage
