# Trestle Authoring Workflow

## The Generate-Edit-Assemble Cycle

Trestle's authoring tools convert OSCAL JSON to markdown for human editing, then back to JSON:

```
JSON (OSCAL) → generate → Markdown (edit) → assemble → JSON (OSCAL)
```

This cycle is continuous: after initial generation, you repeatedly edit markdown and reassemble.

## Author Commands by Model Type

### Catalog Authoring
- `trestle author catalog-generate --name <catalog> --output <md_dir>` → markdown per control
- `trestle author catalog-assemble --markdown <md_dir> --output <catalog>` → JSON catalog

### Profile Authoring
- `trestle author profile-generate --name <profile> --output <md_dir>` → markdown with profile additions
- `trestle author profile-assemble --markdown <md_dir> --output <profile>` → JSON profile
- `trestle author profile-resolve --name <profile> --output <resolved>` → resolved profile catalog

### Component Definition Authoring
- `trestle author component-generate --name <compdef> --output <md_dir>` → markdown per component/control
- `trestle author component-assemble --markdown <md_dir> --output <compdef>` → JSON component-definition

### SSP Authoring
- `trestle author ssp-generate --profile <profile> --compdefs <comp1,comp2> --output <md_dir>` → markdown per control
- `trestle author ssp-assemble --markdown <md_dir> --output <ssp>` → JSON SSP
- `trestle author ssp-filter --name <ssp> --profile <profile> --output <filtered>` → filtered SSP

## Markdown Structure

### Control Markdown File
Each control gets its own `.md` file with:
1. **YAML header** - metadata, parameters, properties
2. **Control title** - `# control-id - [Group Title] Control Title`
3. **Control Statement** - `## Control Statement` with labeled parts
4. **Control guidance** - `## Control guidance`
5. **Additional sections** - Implementation responses, component sections

### YAML Header Tags (x-trestle-*)
| Tag | Purpose |
|-----|---------|
| `x-trestle-set-params` | Parameter values for the control |
| `x-trestle-global` | Global metadata (sort-id, profile title) |
| `x-trestle-sections` | Map of section short names to display names |
| `x-trestle-add-props` | Properties to add to the control |
| `x-trestle-comp-def-rules` | Rules from component definitions |
| `x-trestle-comp-def-rules-param-vals` | Rule parameter values |
| `x-trestle-inherited-props` | Properties inherited from upstream |
| `x-trestle-leveraging-comp` | Leveraged component information |
| `x-trestle-statement` | Statement-level metadata |

### Parameter Handling

**In catalog markdown** (`x-trestle-set-params`):
```yaml
x-trestle-set-params:
  ac-1_prm_1:
    values:
      - organization-defined value
    label: descriptive label
```

**In profile markdown** (adds `profile-values`):
```yaml
x-trestle-set-params:
  ac-1_prm_1:
    values:
      - catalog value
    profile-values:
      - profile-specific value
```

**In SSP markdown** (adds `ssp-values`):
```yaml
x-trestle-set-params:
  ac-1_prm_1:
    values:
      - resolved value
    ssp-values:
      - ssp-specific value
```

## Key Options

| Option | Commands | Purpose |
|--------|----------|---------|
| `--set-parameters` | catalog-assemble, profile-assemble | Apply parameter changes from YAML header |
| `--overwrite-header-values` | all -generate | Overwrite existing header values with provided YAML |
| `--force-overwrite` | all -generate | Erase existing markdown before regenerating |
| `--yaml` / `-y` | all -generate | Provide external YAML header to merge |
| `--version` | all -assemble | Set version in assembled model |
| `--regenerate` | all -assemble | Generate new UUIDs |
| `--sections` | profile-assemble | Define allowed sections |
| `--required-sections` | profile-assemble | Sections that must be present |
| `--compdefs` | ssp-generate | Comma-separated component definitions |

## Implementation Status Values
Controls track implementation status with these values:
- `implemented` - Fully implemented
- `partial` - Partially implemented
- `planned` - Implementation is planned
- `alternative` - Alternative implementation
- `not-applicable` - Control is not applicable

## Control Origination Values
- `organization` - Organization-level
- `system-specific` - System-specific
- `customer-configured` - Customer configured
- `customer-provided` - Customer provided
- `inherited` - Inherited from another system

## CI/CD Integration
The authoring tools are designed for CI/CD pipelines:
- Assemble commands only write output if content changed (prevents unnecessary triggers)
- `--set-parameters` limits what can change during automated assembly
- `--required-sections` and `--allowed-sections` enforce document structure
- Individual control markdown files enable fine-grained git tracking

## Multi-Repository Coordination

Large organizations split OSCAL artifacts across multiple Git repositories aligned to
ownership boundaries. Trestle's authoring tools support this through CI/CD-driven propagation.

### Repository Topology

```
catalog-repo (Regulators)
    |
    v  imports
profile-repo (Compliance Officers)
    |
    v  references
compdef-repo (Vendors / Control Providers)
    |
    v  combined into
ssp-repo (System Owners)
```

Each repository contains its own trestle workspace (`.trestle/` directory) and manages
artifacts independently with its own CI/CD pipeline.

### Change Propagation Pattern

When an upstream artifact changes:

1. Upstream repo merges markdown edits to main
2. CI/CD runs `trestle author *-assemble` to rebuild OSCAL JSON
3. If JSON changed, CI/CD creates a PR in each downstream repository
4. Downstream owners review the PR, which pulls the updated upstream artifact
5. On merge, the downstream CI/CD assembles its own artifacts with the new input

This pattern uses `repository_dispatch` events (GitHub Actions) or cross-project triggers
(GitLab CI) to connect repositories.

### When to Use Multi-Repo vs Single-Repo

| Factor | Single Repo | Multi-Repo |
|--------|-------------|------------|
| Team size | Small (1-5 people) | Multiple teams or organizations |
| Ownership | Same team owns all artifacts | Different teams own different artifacts |
| Release cadence | Artifacts change together | Independent versioning needed |
| Access control | Same permissions for all | Different access per artifact type |
| Complexity | Simpler setup and maintenance | Better separation of concerns |

**Start with a single repo.** Split when ownership boundaries emerge or when
independent versioning is required.

## Two-Phase Component Definition Authoring

Component definitions combine structured rule data with narrative prose. Trestle supports
a two-phase authoring pattern that uses the best tool for each type of content.

### Phase 1: Rules via CSV Spreadsheet

```bash
# CSV contains structured mappings: rules, parameters, control associations
trestle task csv-to-oscal-cd
```

The CSV captures:
- `Rule_Id`, `Rule_Description` — the technical rule
- `Control_Id_List` — which regulation controls this rule implements
- `Parameter_Id`, `Parameter_Value_Alternatives` — configurable parameters
- `Component_Type` — `Service` (control-to-rule) or `Validation` (rule-to-check)

Vendors manage this CSV in spreadsheet tools. It is committed to Git and
converted to OSCAL JSON via the `csv-to-oscal-cd` task.

### Phase 2: Responses via Markdown

```bash
# Generate markdown from the Phase 1 component definition
trestle author component-generate --name my-service --output md_compdefs/my-service

# Markdown shows rules (read-only) + editable prose sections
# Edit: write implementation descriptions per control per component
# Then reassemble
trestle author component-assemble --markdown md_compdefs/my-service --output my-service
```

The markdown includes:
- Read-only rules section (from Phase 1 CSV data)
- Read-only control description and guidance (from catalog/profile)
- Editable implementation response sections (prose describing HOW the control is met)
- Implementation status (`implemented`, `partial`, `planned`, etc.)

### Why Two Phases?

- **Structured data** (rules, parameters, mappings) is best managed in spreadsheets
- **Narrative prose** (implementation descriptions) is best edited as markdown
- Different personas may own each phase (security engineers write rules; product owners write prose)
- Phase 1 can be automated from tooling; Phase 2 requires human judgment

## Git-Based Authoring Workflow

Trestle's authoring tools are designed for Git-based collaboration with CI/CD automation.

### PR-Based Review Cycle

1. Author edits markdown on a feature branch
2. Opens a PR for peer review
3. CI/CD runs `trestle validate` on the PR to catch errors early
4. Reviewers approve; PR is merged to main
5. CI/CD on main runs `trestle author *-assemble` to rebuild OSCAL JSON
6. If JSON changed, CI/CD commits the updated JSON and (optionally) triggers downstream repos

### Conditional Write Behavior

Assemble commands **only write output if content changed**. This prevents:
- Unnecessary git commits (no-op changes to JSON)
- Infinite CI/CD trigger loops between repositories
- Misleading git history with empty diffs

### Branch Protection Recommendations

| Branch | Protection | Who Can Merge |
|--------|-----------|---------------|
| `main` | Require PR review + CI/CD pass | Artifact owner (per persona) |
| Feature branches | No protection | Any contributor |

Individual control markdown files enable fine-grained git tracking — reviewers can see
exactly which controls were modified in a PR diff.

## Models Without Author Commands

Not all OSCAL models have `trestle author` generate/assemble commands. The following models use a **JSON-based workflow** instead:

| Model | `trestle author` Support | Workflow |
|-------|--------------------------|----------|
| Catalog | `catalog-generate` / `catalog-assemble` | Markdown roundtrip |
| Profile | `profile-generate` / `profile-assemble` | Markdown roundtrip |
| Component Definition | `component-generate` / `component-assemble` | Markdown roundtrip |
| SSP | `ssp-generate` / `ssp-assemble` | Markdown roundtrip |
| **Assessment Plan** | **None** | `create → split → edit → merge → validate` |
| **Assessment Results** | **None** | `create → split → edit → merge → validate` |
| **POA&M** | **None** | `create → split → edit → merge → validate` |

### JSON-Based Workflow

For assessment plans, assessment results, and POA&M:

```bash
# 1. Create a new model with placeholder fields
trestle create -t <model-type> -o <name>

# 2. Split into editable sections
trestle split -f <model-file>.json -e '<model-type>.<element1>,<model-type>.<element2>'

# 3. Edit the resulting JSON files directly

# 4. Merge sections back together
trestle merge -e '<model-type>.<element1>,<model-type>.<element2>'

# 5. Validate the final model
trestle validate -t <model-type> -n <name>
```

For detailed workflows, see the `trestle-assessment` skill (assessment plans and results) and the `trestle-poam` skill (plan of action and milestones).
