# Trestle Workspace Management

## Workspace Structure

A trestle workspace is an opinionated directory structure (similar to git) that manages OSCAL compliance documents.

### Core Directories

```
.
├── .trestle/              # Config dir (config.ini, cache, templates)
├── dist/                  # Assembled output files
│   ├── catalogs/
│   ├── profiles/
│   ├── component-definitions/
│   ├── system-security-plans/
│   ├── assessment-plans/
│   ├── assessment-results/
│   └── plan-of-action-and-milestones/
├── catalogs/              # Catalog source models
├── profiles/              # Profile source models
├── component-definitions/ # Component definition source models
├── system-security-plans/ # SSP source models
├── assessment-plans/      # Assessment plan source models
├── assessment-results/    # Assessment results source models
└── plan-of-action-and-milestones/  # POA&M source models
```

### Model Instance Layout

Each model instance lives in its own subdirectory:
```
catalogs/
└── nist-800-53/
    └── catalog.json       # The actual OSCAL model file
```

## Initialization Modes

`trestle init` creates the workspace. Three modes available:

| Mode | Flag | Creates | Use Case |
|------|------|---------|----------|
| Full | `--full` (default) | `.trestle/` + `dist/` + all model dirs | Full functionality: local models, API, governed docs |
| Local | `--local` | `.trestle/` + all model dirs (no `dist/`) | Local OSCAL model management only |
| GovDocs | `--govdocs` | `.trestle/` only | Document governance only |

## Key Rules

- File and directory names created by trestle MUST NOT be changed manually
- Within one model directory, do not mix JSON and YAML formats
- The `.trestle/` directory contains config files, caches, and templates
- The `dist/` directory holds assembled/merged output files
- Model files can be JSON (`.json`) or YAML (`.yaml`, `.yml`)
- Default format is JSON; YAML is supported on a best-effort basis

## Configuration

The workspace config lives at `.trestle/config.ini`. It can store task configurations and other settings used by trestle commands.

## Common Operations

- **Check if workspace exists**: Look for `.trestle/` directory
- **List models**: Check subdirectories of model-type directories (e.g., `catalogs/*/catalog.json`)
- **Validate workspace**: Run `trestle validate -a` to validate all models
