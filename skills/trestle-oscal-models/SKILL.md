# OSCAL Model Types in Trestle

## The 7 OSCAL Model Types

| Model Type | CLI Name | Directory | Description |
|-----------|----------|-----------|-------------|
| Catalog | `catalog` | `catalogs/` | Collection of security controls (e.g., NIST 800-53) |
| Profile | `profile` | `profiles/` | Selection and modification of controls from catalogs |
| Component Definition | `component-definition` | `component-definitions/` | How a component implements controls |
| System Security Plan | `system-security-plan` | `system-security-plans/` | Complete system security documentation |
| Assessment Plan | `assessment-plan` | `assessment-plans/` | Plan for assessing security controls |
| Assessment Results | `assessment-results` | `assessment-results/` | Results of security assessment |
| POA&M | `plan-of-action-and-milestones` | `plan-of-action-and-milestones/` | Remediation tracking |

## Model Relationships

```
Catalog (controls)
    ↓ imports
Profile (selects + modifies controls)
    ↓ resolved profile catalog
Component Definition (how components implement controls)
    ↓ combined
System Security Plan (complete system documentation)
    ↓ assessed by
Assessment Plan → Assessment Results → POA&M
```

### The Catalog → Profile → SSP Chain

1. **Catalog** defines controls (e.g., NIST 800-53 has ~1000 controls)
2. **Profile** imports controls from catalogs/profiles, selects subset, modifies parameters
3. **Resolved Profile Catalog** is the effective set of controls after profile modifications
4. **Component Definition** describes how specific components address controls
5. **SSP** combines profile + component definitions into implementation documentation

### Profile Imports
A profile can import from:
- One or more catalogs
- One or more other profiles
- A mix of catalogs and profiles

Each import selects specific controls and can modify parameters and add content.

## Common OSCAL Fields

All models share:
- `uuid` - Unique identifier
- `metadata` - Title, version, last-modified, oscal-version, roles, parties
- `back-matter` - Resources, citations, attachments

## File Formats
- JSON (default): `.json`
- YAML: `.yaml` or `.yml`
- Within one model directory, don't mix formats

## Element Paths
Trestle uses dot-notation to address elements within models:
- `catalog.metadata` - The metadata of a catalog
- `catalog.groups.*.controls.*` - All controls in all groups
- `catalog.groups.0.controls.3` - Specific control (0-indexed)

Rules:
- Paths are relative to the file being operated on
- Use `*` wildcard for arrays (quote on *nix shells)
- Array syntax can be skipped: `catalog.controls.control` = `catalog.groups.controls.control`

## Trestle Operations on Models

| Operation | Command | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| Create | `trestle create -t <type> -o <name>` | Create bare-bones sample model |
| Import | `trestle import -f <file> -o <name>` | Import existing OSCAL file |
| Split | `trestle split -f <file> -e <elements>` | Decompose into sub-files |
| Merge | `trestle merge -e <elements>` | Reassemble split files |
| Describe | `trestle describe -f <file> -e <element>` | Inspect model structure |
| Validate | `trestle validate -f <file>` or `-t <type> -n <name>` or `-a` | Check model integrity |
| Assemble | `trestle assemble <type> -n <name>` | Combine split parts to dist/ |
| Replicate | `trestle replicate <type> -n <name> -o <new>` | Copy/rename model |

## SSP Special Concepts

- **This System** component: Default component in every SSP (name: "This System")
- **By-Component responses**: Implementation prose organized by component
- **Rules and Parameters**: Embedded in component definition properties, propagated to SSP
- **Implementation Status**: Tracked per-component per-control
- **Leveraged SSPs**: Inheritance from provider systems

## Persona Ownership

Each OSCAL model type has a primary owner persona responsible for authoring and maintaining it:

| Model Type | Primary Persona | Trestle Commands | Notes |
|-----------|----------------|-----------------|-------|
| Catalog | Regulators | `catalog-generate`, `catalog-assemble` | Source of truth for controls |
| Profile | Compliance Officers / CISO | `profile-generate`, `profile-assemble` | Tailored baselines with org guidance |
| Component Definition (Service) | Control Providers (vendors) | `csv-to-oscal-cd`, `component-generate/assemble` | Maps controls to product rules |
| Component Definition (Validation) | Control Assessors (PVP vendors) | `csv-to-oscal-cd` (with `Check_Id`) | Maps rules to automated checks |
| System Security Plan | System Owners / CIO | `ssp-generate`, `ssp-assemble` | Combines profile + compdefs |
| Assessment Plan | Assessors / CISO | `create`, `split`, `merge` | Defines assessment scope |
| Assessment Results | Assessors / PVP tools | `xccdf-result-to-oscal-ar`, `tanium-result-to-oscal-ar` | Scan findings |
| POA&M | System Owners | `create`, `split`, `merge` | Remediation tracking |

In real organizations, one person may fill multiple persona roles. The ownership mapping
is logical (separation of duties), not necessarily physical (one person per artifact).

## Component Definition: The Bridge Artifact

The component definition plays a unique bridging role in the OSCAL model chain. It connects
regulatory controls (governance layer) to automated assessment (technical layer) through
two distinct component types:

### Layer 1 — Service Components (Control-to-Rule)

Service components declare which technology-specific rules implement a regulation control:
- Authored by product vendors and service providers
- Maps: **Control** (e.g., AC-2) --> **Rule** (e.g., `rule-account-types`) --> **Parameter** (e.g., `timeout=15min`)
- Created via CSV spreadsheet (`csv-to-oscal-cd` with `Component_Type=Service`)
- Prose responses added via markdown (`component-generate` / `component-assemble`)

### Layer 2 — Validation Components (Rule-to-Check)

Validation components declare which PVP checks validate a rule:
- Authored by assessment tool vendors and compliance engineers
- Maps: **Rule** (e.g., `rule-account-types`) --> **Check_Id** (e.g., `test_github.GitHubOrgs.test_members_is_not_empty`)
- Created via CSV spreadsheet (`csv-to-oscal-cd` with `Component_Type=Validation` and `Check_Id` column)
- Consumed by C2P (Compliance-to-Policy) to bridge to runtime assessment

### End-to-End Traceability

Together, the two layers create the full compliance automation chain:

```
Regulation Control (NIST AC-2)
    --> Service Rule (rule-account-types)
        --> Validation Check (test_github.GitHubOrgs.test_members)
            --> Assessment Result (pass/fail)
                --> Control Posture (satisfied/not-satisfied)
```

This traceability enables automated posture computation: given PVP results, map
backward through component definitions to determine control-level compliance status.
